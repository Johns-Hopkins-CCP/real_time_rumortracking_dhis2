Please read the  Real-Time Rumor Tracking For COVID-19 â€“ System Design And Implementation Guide

This document is written for humanitarian or public health organizations as well as national governments seeking to document rumors in a systematic and dynamic fashion. First, the document provides an overview of the role of rumors in a public health or humanitarian emergency, followed by a summary of the community-based approach taken by Breakthrough ACTION during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, the guide lays out an application of this approach using the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) open source software platform, including an overview of a pre-configured metadata package that can be installed on a new DHIS2 system or imported to an existing system. While this guide and the associated DHIS2 package were developed for COVID-19, rumors play a role in a variety of public health issues. Real-time monitoring of rumors thus provides a unique opportunity for dynamic two-way communication with communities.
